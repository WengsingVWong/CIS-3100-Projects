# CIS-3100-Projects
C++ projects created for my CIS 3100 (Object-Oriented Programming 1) class. <br />
As of April 8, 2019, there are 4 C++ programs within this repository: <br />

* A program that asks the user to input an integer and outputs a pyramid of stars **pointing up** with a number of rows equal to the integer inputted
* A program that asks the user to input an integer and outputs a pyramid of stars **pointing right** with the middle row containing a number os stars equal to the integer inputted
* A program that asks the user to input an integer and outputs an **upside-down** pyramid of stars with a number of rows equal to the integer inputted
* A program that asks the user to input an integer and outputs a pyramid of stars **pointing left** with the middle row containing a number of stars equal to the integer inputted

On June 11, 2019, I renamed the folder "Outputting a Pyramid of Stars (Pointing Up)" to "Programming Assignment 1 - Outputting a Pyramid of Stars (Pointing Up)" in order to prepare my repository for when I upload the other programming assignments I completed for that class.
