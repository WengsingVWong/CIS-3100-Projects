# CIS-3100-Projects
C++ projects created for my CIS 3100 (Object-Oriented Programming 1) class. <br />
As of April 8, 2019, there are 4 C++ programs within this repository: <br />

* A program that asks the user to input an integer and outputs a pyramid of stars **pointing up** with a number of rows equal to the integer inputted (this was Programming Assignment 1)
* A program that asks the user to input an integer and outputs a pyramid of stars **pointing right** with the middle row containing a number os stars equal to the integer inputted
* A program that asks the user to input an integer and outputs an **upside-down** pyramid of stars with a number of rows equal to the integer inputted
* A program that asks the user to input an integer and outputs a pyramid of stars **pointing left** with the middle row containing a number of stars equal to the integer inputted

On June 11, 2019, I renamed the folder "Outputting a Pyramid of Stars (Pointing Up)" to "Programming Assignment 1 - Outputting a Pyramid of Stars (Pointing Up)" in order to prepare my repository for when I upload the other programming assignments I completed for that class.

On June 12, 2019, I uploaded 4 more C++ programs to this repository: <br />

* A program that plays a user-specified number of games of craps and calculates the percentage of wins (this was Programming Assignment 3)
* A program that asks the user to input valid values for the loan amount, annual interest, number of years to repay the loan, and additional principal (if any) and outputs a mortgage amortization table to an external file, with the file's name being specified by the user (this was Programmming Assignment 4)
* A program that simulates a user-specified number of Powerball drawings and displays the results of each on screen (this was Programming Assignment 5)
* A program that creates a Rational Number Class, which allows rational numbers (i.e. fractions) to be inputted, outputted, and used in mathematical and relational expressions, and then tests the class using 4 rational numbers inputted by the user (this was Programming Assignment 6)

**Note**: Programming Assignment 2 is not included in this repository. Programming Assignment 2 was to write a program that would ask the user to input valid values for the loan amount, annual interest, number of years to repay the loan, and additional principal (if any) and displays a mortgage amortization table on the screen. The purpose of Programming Assignment 4 was actually to build on the code written for Assignment 2 in order to output a mortgage amortization table to an external file (as opposed to the screen). In other words, the code for Programming Assignment 2 is mostly present in Assignment 4 (albeit with a few changes here and there), so I thought that including Programming Assignment 2 in this repository would be redundant.
